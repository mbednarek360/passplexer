# PassPlexer
## A Password Obfuscation Algorithm
---
## **Description**
PassPlexer is designed to create a more secure password without having to remember it.   

Just use a single master password with a username and service name to create a new password.
This is designed to seperate the passwords used on different websites and make it more difficult for attackers
to come to a conclusion about such password. If such an attacker managed to find a password used on multiple of your accounts, congrats, they now have access to multiple of your accounts. However, if they have access to a password generated by this program, they will not be able to access other sites as they need the master password to do so.

This does not mean you should use a bad master password and expect infinite
security. It just makes it easier to mitigate poor habits. If an attacker knew
your username and service, then all they would need to do is break two hashes, although if the password is stored in plaintext, this is better than none.

No user information is logged or transmitted by using this program. This can be run entirely offline.
